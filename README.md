# Next.js Project Bootstrapped with Create Next App

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Download and install Node.js from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm (Node Package Manager) automatically.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone this project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <project_name>
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the required packages using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Alternatively, you can use other package managers:

```bash
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### Step 4: Run the Development Server

Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

### Step 5: Open in Browser

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the application.

## Project Structure

You can start editing the application by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you save the file.

### API Routes

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) are located in the `pages/api` directory. For example:

- Access the default API route at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello).
- Modify the API route in `pages/api/hello.js` as needed.

Files in the `pages/api` directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

## Fonts Optimization

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - Comprehensive documentation about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn-pages-router) - An interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can also explore the [Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js). Feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is through the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme), created by the developers of Next.js.
